        <h3>Hazaribagh National Park</h3>
        <p>The Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary, established in 1955, is a protected area on a low, hilly plateau in Jharkhand. 
          Once a royal hunting ground, it features lush tropical forests, hills, and grassy meadows, with a central lake. 
          While tiger populations have dwindled, the sanctuary is home to a variety of animals, including sambar, nilgai, wild boar, sloth bears, and leopards. 
          Visitors can explore the sanctuary through jeep safaris or observe wildlife from watchtowers, particularly around waterholes during dawn and dusk. 
          The best time to visit is from October to April, and accommodation is available within the park.</p>
